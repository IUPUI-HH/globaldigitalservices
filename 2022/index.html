                    Cicero has been traditionally considered the master of Latin prose, with Quintilian
                    declaring Cicero was "not the name of a man, but of eloquence itself." He is credited with transforming
                    Latin from a modest utilitarian language into a versatile literary medium capable of expressing abstract and
                    complicated thoughts with clarity.
